# MIScnn-for-nuclei-segmentation
Here I slightly modified a project committed by @muellerdo (https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/MIScnn) so it works with newest versions (2023) of libraries used in it. Specifically, I changes subfunctions performance, including functions ChangeValues, Resampling and Resize.

MIScnn is a library which simplifies training and predictions for segmentation of medical images.

To use this version of MIScnn, clone it to your destination folder:
git clone https://github.com/alinashtork/MIScnn-for-nuclei-segmentation
